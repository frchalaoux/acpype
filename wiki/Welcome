= Welcome to ACPYPI! =

A tool based on Python to use *Antechamber* to generate topologies for chemical compounds and to interface with others python applications like [http://www.ccpn.ac.uk CCPN] tools or [http://aria.pasteur.fr ARIA].

*acpypi* is pronounced as "_ace + pipe_".

Topologies files to be generated so far:
CNS/XPLOR, GROMACS, CHARMM and AMBER.

Latest version of  *ANTECHAMBER* can be found in [http://ambermd.org/#AmberTools AmberTools 1.3].

NB: Topologies generated by *acpypi/Antechamber* are based on General Amber Force Field (GAFF) and should be used only with compatible force fields like AMBER and its variants.

Several flavours of AMBER FF are ported already for GROMACS (see [http://chemistry.csulb.edu/ffamber/ ffAMBER]) as well as for XPLOR/CNS (see [http://ambermd.org/xplor-nih.html xplor-nih]) and CHARMM.

Please, read *[http://code.google.com/p/acpypi/w/list ACPYPI Wiki pages]* for more information.
