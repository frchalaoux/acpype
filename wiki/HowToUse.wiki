= How To Use ACPYPI = 

_It's still under development_

== Introduction ==

To run *acpypi*, you need *ANTECHAMBER* from package [http://amber.scripps.edu/#AmberTools amberTools] and [http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page Open Babel] if your input files are of PDB format.

Download *acpypi* via:

`svn checkout http://acpypi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ acpypi`

== To Test ==

At dir *acpypi/test*, type:

  * ` ../acpypi.py -i FFF.pdb`

It'll create a folder called *FFF.acpypi*, and inside it one may find topology files for GROMACS and CNS/XPLOR.

To get help and more information, type:

  *  `../acpypi.py -h`
