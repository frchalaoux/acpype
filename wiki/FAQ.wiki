= How ACPYPI Works =

* *Q:* Why only one residue per try?
  *A:* *ACPYPI* is not ready to deal with more than one chain. In fact,
  *antechamber* will likely take the first residue name and apply for all.
  Results can be completely unpredictable. Split your molecular system with one
  ligand only in each pdb/mol2 file.

* *Q:* I have a modified residue in my protein or ligand covalently bonded to
  my protein and *ACPYPI* doesn't work. Why?
  *A:* *ACPYPI* is not that smart to automatise this process, but one can still
  obtain a topology. Soon a tutorial will be available.
