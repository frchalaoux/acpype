  * *Q: How do I install _acpypi_?*
  * *A:* Please, read [HowToUse How To Use ACPYPI] wiki page.

  * *Q: Why only one residue per try?*
  * *A:* *ACPYPI* is not ready to deal with more than one chain. In fact, *antechamber* will likely take the first residue name and apply for all. Results can be completely unpredictable. Split your molecular system with one ligand only in each pdb/mol2 file.

  * *Q: I have a modified residue in my protein or ligand covalently bonded to  my protein and ACPYPI doesn't work. Why?*
  * *A:* *ACPYPI* is not that smart to automatise this procedure, but one can still obtain a topology. Soon a tutorial will be available.

  * ~~*Q: _amb2gmx.pl_ doesn't use _antechamber_ and needs only _parmtop_ and _inpcrd_ files. Why _acpypi_ cannot reproduce _amb2gmx.pl_ completely?*~~
  * ~~*A:* Not yet! In fact, this feature is on progress. Once done, one will be able to use *tleap/sleap/xleap* from *AMBER* package to generate _parmtop_ and _inpcrd_ files and use them to generate GROMACS files via *acpypi*, in the way *amb2gmx.pl* does, with no need of *ffAMBER*.~~
      **DONE!*

  * *Q: I downloaded a pdb file from [http://www.pdb.org PDB] and it seems to not have hydrogens. When I use _acpypi_ it fails, why?*
  * *A:* You definitely needs a pdb/mol2 input file with all atoms (including hydrogens), otherwise *antechamber* (including a step with *mopac*) will not know or (even worse) will calculate wrong parameters and charges. You can use e.g. [http://www.yasara.org YASARA View] to automatically add missing hydrogens to your compound.
