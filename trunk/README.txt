= ACPYPI =

A tool based in Python to use Antechamber to generate topologies for chemical
compounds and to interface with others python applications like CCPN or ARIA.

acpypi is pronounced as "ace + pipe"

Topologies files to be generated so far: CNS/XPLOR, GROMACS

NB: Topologies generated by acpypi/Antechamber are based on General Amber Force
Field (GAFF) and should be used only with compatible forcefields like AMBER and
its variant.

Several flavours of AMBER FF are ported already for GROMACS (see ffamber:
http://chemistry.csulb.edu/ffamber/) as well as to XPLOR/CNS (see xplor-nih:
http://amber.scripps.edu/xplor-nih.html)

It was inspired by:

- amb2gmx.pl (Eric Sorin, David Mobley and John Chodera)
  and depends on Antechamber and Openbabel

= How To Use ACPYPI =

== Introduction ==

To run *acpypi*, you need *ANTECHAMBER* from package
[http://amber.scripps.edu/#AmberTools amberTools] and
[http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page Open Babel] if your input files are of PDB
format.

Download *acpypi* via:

  * `svn checkout http://acpypi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ acpypi`

== To Test ==

At folder *acpypi/test*, type:

  * `../acpypi.py -i FFF.pdb`

It'll create a folder called *FFF.acpypi*, and inside it one may find topology
files for GROMACS and CNS/XPLOR.

To get help and more information, type:

  * `../acpypi.py -h`

== To Verify with GMX ==
{{{
cd FFF.acpypi/
grompp -c FFF_GMX.gro -p FFF_GMX.top -f em.mdp -o em.tpr
mdrun -v -deffnm em
# And if you have VMD
vmd em.gro em.trr

# For MD, do:
grompp -c em.gro -p FFF_GMX.top -f md.mdp -o md.tpr
mdrun -v -deffnm md
vmd md.gro md.trr
}}}

== To Verify with CNS/XPLOR ==
At folder *FFF.acpypi*, type:
  * `cns < FFF_CNS.inp`

== To Install ==

At folder *acpypi*, type:

  * `ln -s $PWD/acpypi.py /usr/local/bin/acpypi`

And re-login or start another shell session.
